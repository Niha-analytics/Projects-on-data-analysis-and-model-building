# Machine Learning
In this Repository, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and the exciting world of building machine learning models using Python. These projects represent the culmination of diligent work and a passion for leveraging data to derive meaningful insights and create predictive models.

**1**)[Extraalearn data analysis and predictive model building](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-on-data-analysis-and-model-building/tree/main/Extraalean%2Banalysis%20and%20predictive%20model%20building)
 
 \nIn this project i have done indepth analysis of Lead's data from within extraalearn website to determine the driving factors behine the leads's conversion into paid customers.
 For modelling I have tried different models like Decision Tree and Random Forest and compared which model provided us better results. I also used hyper parameter tuning to enhance the performance of my model.
