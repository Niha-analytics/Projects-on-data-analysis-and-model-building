# Machine Learning
In this Repository, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and building machine learning models using Python. These projects represent the culmination of diligent work and a passion for leveraging data to derive meaningful insights and create predictive models.

**1**) [Extraalearn data analysis and predictive model building](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-on-data-analysis-and-model-building/tree/main/Extraalean%2Banalysis%20and%20predictive%20model%20building)
 
 In this project i have done indepth analysis of Lead's data from within extraalearn website to determine the driving factors behine the leads's conversion into paid customers.
 For modelling I have tried different models like Decision Tree and Random Forest and compared which model provided us better results. I also used hyper parameter tuning to enhance the performance of my model.

 
**2** [Exploring Auto-MPG Data: Analysis, Regression Modeling, and PCA Implementation](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-on-data-analysis-and-model-building/tree/main/Auto-mpg%20case%20study_PCA)

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the MPG dataset, deciphering the intricate relationships among variables and their impact on the target variable, MPG. Employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, I delved into the complex patterns and relationships between variables and visualize them in 2D space. Utilizing these principle components while ensuring precision in capturing essential data variances, I constructed a Multiple Linear Regression model . This abstract encapsulates my comprehensive exploration of the MPG dataset, emphasizing the detailed approach I employed for analysis and modeling.


**3** [Unraveling the Challenger Tragedy: A Deep Dive into What Went Wrong](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-on-data-analysis-and-model-building/tree/main/Challenger%20Case%20study)

This case study, undertaken during my machine learning course, illuminated the profound impact of data-driven decision-making, a lesson starkly illustrated by the Challenger incident. It stands as a poignant reminder of the pivotal role data holds in shaping our choices, especially in critical situations. Intrigued by its relevance, I delved deeper and penned an article, emphasizing the indispensable nature of data in guiding our decisions. This incident underscores the vital importance of embracing data-based insights, ensuring informed and responsible decision-making in today's complex world. You can explore the detailed insights in the article I wrote on this topic here.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/challenger-tragedy-chandrayaan-3-triumph-data-driven-srivastava%3FtrackingId=uI2IzAhOUW%252Boe%252FE2%252BwCnig%253D%253D/?trackingId=uI2IzAhOUW%2Boe%2FE2%2BwCnig%3D%3D)
